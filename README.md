## Pull Request Diff Check

When installed on a repository, this app watches pull requests and sends their
diffs to the OpenAI API. The API response is expected to be a JSON array of
inline review comments which are posted directly on the relevant lines of the
pull request. Configure an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable for the app to
enable these reviews.
